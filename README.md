Advantages of Functional-Style code:
1. The code is more concise. When using the functional style code, it takes very less number of lines 
   than the non-functional style.
2. It is easier to make the code parallelized.
3. The code is more expressive and intuitive. The code becomes more verbose, readable and easier to understand 
   as the intent of code is more obvious. Functional style programming conveys the intent more effectively than 
   non-functional style. 
4. Using functional style means less mutability. Less mutability leads to more fewer errors.    


Lexical Scoping:
    It is a powerful technique that allows to cache values from one context for use later 
    in another context.
